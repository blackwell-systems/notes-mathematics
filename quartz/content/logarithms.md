**Logarithm:** A logarithm is the inverse of an exponential function. It answers the question: "To what exponent must we raise the base to get a certain number?"

## Definition

Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $a > 0$, $a \neq 1$

$$\log_a : (0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \forall y \in (0,\infty), \quad y = a^x \Longleftrightarrow x = \log_a(y)$$

In words: If $y = a^x$, then $x = \log_a(y)$

**Example:** $2^3 = 8 \Longleftrightarrow \log_2(8) = 3$

## Common Logarithms

### Natural Logarithm (ln)

**Natural Logarithm:** The logarithm with base $e$ (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828).

$$\ln(x) = \log_e(x)$$

The natural logarithm is the inverse of $e^x$.

### Common Logarithm (log)

**Common Logarithm:** The logarithm with base 10. Often written as $\log(x)$ without a base specified.

$$\log(x) = \log_{10}(x)$$

The common logarithm is the inverse of $10^x$.

### Binary Logarithm (lg)

**Binary Logarithm:** The logarithm with base 2. Common in computer science.

$$\lg(x) = \log_2(x)$$

The binary logarithm is the inverse of $2^x$.

## Fundamental Properties

### Product Rule

$$\log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + \log_a(y)$$

The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.

**Example:** $\log_2(8 \cdot 4) = \log_2(8) + \log_2(4) = 3 + 2 = 5$

### Quotient Rule

$$\log_a\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_a(x) - \log_a(y)$$

The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms.

**Example:** $\log_2\left(\frac{8}{4}\right) = \log_2(8) - \log_2(4) = 3 - 2 = 1$

### Power Rule

$$\log_a(x^n) = n \cdot \log_a(x)$$

The logarithm of a power is the exponent times the logarithm of the base.

**Example:** $\log_2(8^2) = 2 \cdot \log_2(8) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$

### Change of Base Formula

$$\log_a(x) = \frac{\log_b(x)}{\log_b(a)}$$

This allows converting between different logarithm bases. Particularly useful for converting to natural or common logarithms for calculator use.

**Example:** $\log_2(8) = \frac{\ln(8)}{\ln(2)} = \frac{2.079}{0.693} \approx 3$

## Special Values

### Identity

$$\log_a(a) = 1$$

Any base raised to the power 1 equals itself.

**Example:** $\log_2(2) = 1$, $\ln(e) = 1$, $\log(10) = 1$

### Zero

$$\log_a(1) = 0$$

Any base raised to the power 0 equals 1.

**Example:** $\log_2(1) = 0$, $\ln(1) = 0$, $\log(1) = 0$

### Undefined Values

- $\log_a(0)$ is undefined (no power of $a$ gives 0)
- $\log_a(x)$ is undefined for $x < 0$ (in real numbers)
- $\log_1(x)$ is undefined ($1^n = 1$ for all $n$)

## Inverse Relationship

### Logarithm cancels Exponential

$$\log_a(a^x) = x$$

**Example:** $\log_2(2^5) = 5$

### Exponential cancels Logarithm

$$a^{\log_a(x)} = x$$

**Example:** $2^{\log_2(8)} = 8$

## Domain and Range

**Domain:** $(0, \infty)$ - Logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers.

**Range:** $(-\infty, \infty)$ - Logarithms can output any real number.

## Graph Properties

The graph of $y = \log_a(x)$:

- Passes through the point $(1, 0)$ (since $\log_a(1) = 0$)
- Passes through the point $(a, 1)$ (since $\log_a(a) = 1$)
- Has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$
- Increases without bound as $x \rightarrow \infty$ (for $a > 1$)
- Is concave down (for $a > 1$)
- Is the reflection of $y = a^x$ across the line $y = x$

### Base Effects

- When $a > 1$: function is increasing
- When $0 < a < 1$: function is decreasing
- Larger bases grow more slowly

## Applications

### Solving Exponential Equations

Logarithms are used to solve equations where the variable is in the exponent.

**Example:** Solve $2^x = 10$

$$x = \log_2(10) = \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(2)} \approx 3.32$$

### Logarithmic Scales

Many real-world phenomena use logarithmic scales:

- **pH scale** (acidity/alkalinity)
- **Richter scale** (earthquake magnitude)
- **Decibels** (sound intensity)
- **Orders of magnitude** (scientific notation)

### Growth and Decay

Logarithms appear in models of:

- Population growth
- Radioactive decay
- Compound interest
- Algorithm complexity analysis
